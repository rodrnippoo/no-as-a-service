Ever needed a graceful way to say "no"?  
This tiny API returns random, generic, creative, and sometimes hilarious rejection reasons — perfectly suited for any scenario: personal, professional, student life, dev life, or just because.

Built for humans, excuses, and humor.

## 🗒️ Personal Notes

> Forked this for a small side project — using it as the backend for a "Should I do it?" button on my personal site. Planning to run it locally on port `4242` instead of the default `3000` to avoid conflicts with other dev servers I usually have running.
